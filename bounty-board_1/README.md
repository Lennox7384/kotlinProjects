## About This Section

In this initial segment, we lay down the foundation of our game with basic Kotlin syntax:

- **Variable Declaration**:
    - Learned how to declare variables using `var` for mutable variables and `val` for immutable ones.
    - Demonstrated type inference for boolean variables and explicit type declaration for integers.
    - Noted the use of `const val` for compile-time constants, with `HERO_NAME` as an example using SNAKE_CASE for naming.

- **Conditional Statements**:
    - Utilized `if-else` statements to set up different quests based on the `playerLevel`.
    - Introduced conditional expressions to streamline code readability, particularly for setting the `quest` variable based on various conditions.

- **Basic Game Logic**:
    - A simple narrative flow where the hero's level determines the quest they undertake.
    - Demonstrated how Kotlin simplifies logical operations, making the code cleaner and more intuitive.

### Code Overview

- **Main.kt**: Contains the core logic of this game section:
    - Introduction of the hero `Madrigal` and her initial level.
    - Assignment of quests based on the player's level using conditional logic.
    - Basic interaction with the game environment, like approaching a bounty board and embarking on quests.
    - Incrementing the player level to show variable reassignment.

### Future Plans

This is just the beginning! In the next sections of this project, expect:
- More advanced Kotlin features like functions, loops, and collections.
- Introduction of classes and objects for better organization of game data.
- Possibly more complex game mechanics, including combat, inventory systems, or NPC interactions.

### How to Run

To run this part of the project:
1. Ensure you have Kotlin installed or use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA with Kotlin plugin.
2. Open the `Main.kt` file.
3. Run the `main` function.

Enjoy this simple narrative-driven game experience while learning Kotlin basics!
