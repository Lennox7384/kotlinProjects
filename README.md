# Intro to Kotlin Project

Welcome to my Kotlin learning journey through game development!

## Project Overview

This project is designed to explore Kotlin programming concepts through the creation of a simple game. Each part of the project focuses on different aspects of Kotlin:

### Part 1: Basic Game Mechanics
- **Learned**: Variable declaration (`var`, `val`), conditional statements (`if-else`), and basic syntax.
- **Implemented**: A simple game narrative where the player's level determines the quest.

### Upcoming Parts

- **Part 2**:
    - **Expected**: Functions, loops, and basic data structures.
    - **Focus**: Enhancing game logic with more dynamic gameplay elements.

- **Part 3**:
    - **Expected**: Classes, objects, and inheritance.
    - **Focus**: Structuring the game with object-oriented programming principles.

- **Part 4 and Beyond**:
    - **Expected**: Advanced Kotlin features like coroutines, extension functions, and more complex game mechanics.
    - **Focus**: Building a more interactive and engaging game environment.

### How to Run

To run any part of this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the respective directory for each part.
3. Use an IDE with Kotlin support or run via command line with `kotlinc`:
    - Compile with `kotlinc Main.kt -include-runtime -d Main.jar`
    - Run with `java -jar Main.jar`
